# Engineering Thesis Code (WIP)

Here are two attempts at developing AI for StarCraft 2. 
One approach uses Convolutional Neural Networks, while the other employs Proximal Policy Optimization. 
Only the latter proved successful. The code serves as a foundation for future enhancements and experimentation.
And yes, I know, it needs refactoring :(
